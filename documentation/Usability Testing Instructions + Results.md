Methods used to support the Usability Test
Think-Aloud (voice recording) and the above mentioned short surveys (via Google Surveys)

*Review of Usability Survey:
Tom Survey Result: can be viewed above on the 'responses' tab or as PDF in another file
Company Survey Result: can be viewed above on the 'responses' tab or as PDF in another file
Admin Survey Result: can be viewed above on the 'responses' tab or as PDF in another file

Generally Think-Aloud was a lot less useful than we imagined. Too much background noise to be usable (other Rooms were full so we stayed in the lecture room)
Surveys were short, but could have been a little shorter - the best feedback was given orally when asking direct questions, so this may be a better approach when only having a few testees.
Nonetheless, the Usability Testing confirmed issues we saw and opened our eyes to some new ones and helped to get the clients priorities straight.
